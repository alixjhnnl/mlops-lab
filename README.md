Here’s a polished, clear, and pedagogical version of your Day 1 MLOps lab instructions in English:

# MLOps Foundations – Day 1: Local or On-Prem MLOps

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will learn the core foundations of MLOps, including:

* **Code versioning** using Git
* **Data versioning** with DVC
* **Pipeline modularity** 
* **Best practices** in Python: logging, type hints, docstrings, CLI, and code quality with pre-commit hooks
* **Continuous Integration (CI)** automation using GitHub Actions
* **Environment management** with Conda and Poetry
* **Unit testing** using Pytest

By the end of the lab, you will be able to set up a full local MLOps pipeline and automate testing and code quality checks.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following are installed:

* **Git** – [Git official site](https://git-scm.com/about)
* **Python 3.11 or higher**
* **Miniconda / Anaconda** – [Installation guide](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main)

## Step 1: Fork the Repository 

Forking allows you to have your own GitHub copy to push changes and experiment safely.

1. Go to the GitHub repository: `https://github.com/TouyeAchille/mlops-lab`
2. Click **Fork** in the top-right corner.
3. Clone your forked repository locally using the command in Step 2.

---

## Step 2: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TouyeAchille/mlops-lab.git
```

---

## Step 3: Change Directory

```bash
cd mlops-lab
```

---

## Step 3: Check Repository Status

```bash
git status
```

This ensures your local repository is correctly initialized and tracks your changes.

## Lab 1 Structure

Follow instructions in `mlops-lab1-instruction` and complete the lab in order:

1. **Environment Management & Packages**
2. **Code Versioning**
3. **Code Quality**
4. **Data Versioning**
5. **CI Automation**

**Recommended workflow**:
```
environment-management-package -> code-versioning -> code-quality -> data-versioning -> automation-ci

## Git Remote Repositories

A **remote repository** is a hosted version of your Git project, enabling collaboration, backup, and CI/CD.

### Common Types

1. **Open-Source / Public Platforms**

   * **GitHub** – Most widely used; supports public/private repos, pull requests, issues, and GitHub Actions.
   * **GitLab** – Supports similar features and offers self-hosted options with strong CI/CD pipelines.

2. **Cloud / Enterprise Repositories**

   * **Azure Repos** – Part of Azure DevOps; integrates with pipelines and work item tracking.
   * **AWS CodeCommit** – Managed Git repos on AWS, fully private.
   * **Google Cloud Source Repositories** – Integrated with GCP services for CI/CD.

### Why GitHub for This Lab

We use **GitHub** because:

* Free and easy to set up for students and small teams.
* Integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions.
* Supports collaborative development with pull requests and code reviews.
* Public visibility allows sharing and contributing to open-source projects.
